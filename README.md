# Product Demand Forecast

## Kaggle and Datasource

The data worked on in this project are public. They were taken from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/grupo-bimbo-inventory-demand/data) website.

## Summary:

### The business problem:

The lack of precision in calculating the demand for products generates waste for the company. Products may be out of stock, leading to the loss of a purchase how can they spoil on the shelf. As the company has products with a short shelf life, the acceptable margin for error is small.

### Objective of the work:

Create a regression model that is capable of accurately estimating demand.

### Language Used:

This work was carried out with the R language.

## Conclusion:

The model achieved an average accuracy of 99% allowing the completion of the project. The linear regression algorithm proved to be very effective for this data set.
